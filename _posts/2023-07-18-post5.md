In my [previous post](./20230532), I started talking about the essay "Reason and Belief in God" by [Alvin Plantinga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Plantinga). In the first part, we briefly examined the arguments against the obligatory nature of atheism by Plantinga. In this post, we will examine the refutation of classical foundationalism.

### Classical Foundationalism Defined

[Classical foundationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundationalism#Classical_foundationalism) has been a central theory in epistemology for a long time in Western philosophy. It is the view that all knowledge and justified belief are ultimately based upon a foundation of noninferential knowledge or justified belief. This foundation is justified by at least one of the following conditions: (1) it is **self-evident**, (2) **evident to the senses** or (3) **incorrigible***. Foundations are the propositions that are **properly basic**.

* Plantinga uses the word "incorrigible" for propositions like "I seem to see something green" - which are basically not falsifiable for one. To put it more formally: $$p$$ is incorrigible for $$S$$ if and only if (a) it is not possible that $$S$$ believe $$p$$ and $$p$$ be false, and (b) it is not possible that $$S$$ believe $$~p$$ and $$p$$ be true.

Plantinga comes with a concept called *noetic structure*. Noetic structure of a person is the set of propositions he believes, together with certain epistemic relations that hold among him and these propositions. A noetic structure is rational if it could be the 
noetic structure of a person who was completely rational. Properties of the rational noetic structure from a foundationalist perspective are:
- **Irreflexivity**: A proposition $$A$$ cannot be believed on the basis of $$A$$. Here, don't confuse a *self-evident* expression with reflexivity. An expression like 2 + 1 = 3 is self-evident; this is not to say that it is its own evidence, but that no evidence is needed for it.
- **Asymmetry**: If my belief that $$A$$ is based upon my belief that $$B$$, then my belief that $$B$$ is not based upon my belief that $$A$$. For example, if someone rationally believes in the existence of God based on a religious scripture that suggests His existence (belief $$A$$ is based on belief $$B$$), then their trust in that religious text shouldn't be based on their belief in the existence of God (belief $$B$$ is not based on belief $$A$$).
- **Basic beliefs**: In a rational noetic structure some beliefs will not be based on any other beliefs; some beliefs will be **basic**. These beliefs are the foundation of that noetic structure.

According to Plantinga, the classical foundationalism can be formulated as follows:
- (1) $$p$$ is rationally acceptable for $$S$$ only if either (i) $$p$$ is self-evident or evident to the senses or incorrigible for $$S$$, or (ii) there are paths in $$S$$'s noetic structure from $$p$$ to propositions $$q_1, ..., q_n$$ that (a) are basic for $$S$$, (b) are self-evident, evident to the senses, or incorrigible for $$S$$, and (c) support $$p$$.

### Refutation

Firstly, we have to notice that the classical foundationalism is a normative contention or claim. It provides us with a thesis about how a system of beliefs ought to be structured.
Now, a foundationalist would accept the following proposition without hesitation:
* (2) $$A$$ is properly basic for me only if $$A$$ is self-evident or incorrigible or evident to the senses for me.

Plantinga suggests that there are two problems with (2):
- i. This proposition itself is neither self-evident nor evident to the senses nor incorrigible for me. Therefore rationally accepting (2) requires us to have path from (2) to properly basic propositions $$q_1, ..., q_n$$ in our noetic structure. And it appears that the foundationalist does not know of any support for (2) from propositions that are properly basic. To conclude, believing in the one of the underlying ideas of foundationalism, does not seem to be rational (at least the proper path is found), according to the foundationalism. One is self-referentially inconsistent in accepting (2) that does not meet the condition for proper basicality that (2) lays down.
- ii. Many propositions that do not seem to meet the conditions in (2) are still properly basic for one, some of which can be believing in the existence of other people or believing in the existence of the past. 

Plantinga suggests that nearly everyone accepts as basic some propositions such as the the existence of other people or the past (but not God). Therefore we might modify the proposition (2) in such a way to encompass those propositions as well. However, we can't escape from the (i) self-referential inconsistency problem.

> So unless we can find an argument for it from propositions that meet the
conditions (2) lays down, we shall, if we believe it, be believing a proposition that is probably either false or such that we ought not believe it. Therefore we ought not believe it, at least until someone produces such an argument for it in any of the cases.

To conclude, **it is not rational to accept classical foundationalism from a classical foundationalist point of view**. But of course, this constitutes just a small part of the answer against evidentialist objections to theism. It is not necessary that evidentialist objection takes the classical foundationalism as basis for his arguments. Anyone, who accepts a different version of foundationalism or even a non-foundationalist epistemology, can still object to theism on the basis of evidentialism. As Plantinga puts it:
> But in order to evaluate it
(the proposed version of foundationalism), we should have to see what criterion of proper basicality was being invoked. In the absence of such specification the objection remains at best a promissory note. So far as the present discussion goes, then, the
next move is up to the evidentialist objector. He must specify a criterion for proper basicality that is free from self-referential difficulties, rules out belief in God as properly basic, and is such that there is some reason to think it is true.
