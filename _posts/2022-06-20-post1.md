Consider an equation like $$A  + B = C $$. In order to interpret the equation correctly, we need to know couple of things beforehand: What are $$A$$, $$B$$ and $$C$$? Are they real numbers or matrices? More formally, what set do they belong to? What does "$$+$$" represent? Of course, one can answer such questions intuitively for the familiar number sets such as the set of natural numbers $$\Bbb{N}$$ or the set of rational numbers $$\Bbb{Q}$$ without referring to the formal definitions. However, as the number of sets on which different operations can be performed increases, classification of such structures (combination of sets and operations) becomes essential. In this blog post, we will be having an humble introduction to algebraic structures starting from <span style="color:blue">semigroups</span> to <span style="color:blue">vector spaces</span>.

To put it simply, an <span style="color:blue">algebraic structure</span> is any set on which at least one <span style="color:blue">binary operation</span> is defined. Algebraic structures can be considered as abstractions that define certain rules on arithmetic operations that can be applied on the members of a specific set. They help us to answer the questions I imposed above analytically. 

#### 1) Binary Operations and Algebraic Structures

##### 1.1) Binary Operations <a name="binary operations"></a>

<span style="color:red">Definition 1.1:</span> A <span style="color:blue">binary operation $$*$$</span> on set $$A$$ is a <span style="color:blue">function<span> $$* : A \times A \to A$$. Since the domain is the cartesian product of set $$A$$ with itself, traditional function notation is $$*((a, b))$$. This notation indicates that the binary operation $$*$$ takes an input in the form of $$(a, b)$$ such that $$(a, b) \in A \times A$$, which indicates that $$a, b \in A$$. We can also use $$a * b$$ to indicate the binary operation on input $$(a, b)$$ for simplicity.

<span style="color:red">Definition 1.2:</span> A binary operation $$*$$ on $$A$$ is called **associative** $$\iff \forall a, b, c \in A \space [(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)]$$

<span style="color:red">Definition 1.3:</span> A binary operation $$*$$ on $$A$$ is called **commutative** $$\iff \forall a, b, c \in A \space [a * b = b * a]$$


<span style="color:MediumPurple">Q1:</span> What is the difference between $$*((a, b))$$ and $$*(a, b)$$? <br>
<span style="color:MediumPurple">A1:</span> First notation indicates a binary operation $$*$$ on input $$(a, b) \in A \times A$$, whereas the second notation indicates a structure that takes two parameters $$a$$ and $$b$$. It doesn't correspond to the binary operation we defined above.

##### 1.2) Algebraic Structures <a name="algebraic structures"></a>

<span style="color:red">Definition 1.4:</span> A nonempty set $$A$$ and binary operations $$f_1, f_2, ..., f_n$$ defined on $$A$$ together is called an <span style="color:blue">algebraic structure</span>, denoted by $$[A, f_1, f_2, ..., f_n]$$, where $$n \in \Bbb{Z}^+$$.


Having made our initial definitions, let's list some of the algebraic structures with one binary operation.

#### 2) Algebraic Structures with One Binary Operation

##### 2.1) Semigroup  <a name="semigroup"></a>
<span style="color:red">Definition 2.1:</span> An algebraic structure $$G = [A, *]$$ is called a <span style="color:blue">semigroup</span> $$\iff$$ $$*$$ is associative.

##### 2.2) Monoid <a name="monoid"></a>
<span style="color:red">Definition 2.2:</span> An algebraic structure $$M = [A, *]$$ is called a <span style="color:blue">monoid</span> $$\iff$$
1. $$M$$ is a <span style="color:blue">semigroup</span>. 
2. $$M$$ has the _identity_, denoted by $$e$$. 

So, according to the first condition every <span style="color:blue">monoid</span> is also a <span style="color:blue">semigroup</span>. What about the second condition? What is an _identity_?

<span style="color:red">Definition 2.3:</span> 
1. $$l \in A$$ is called _left-identity_ $$\iff \forall a \in A \space  [l * a = a]$$. 
2. $$r \in A$$ is called _right-identity_ $$\iff \forall a \in A \space  [a * r = a]$$. 
3. $$e \in A$$ is called _identity_ $$\iff \forall a \in A \space  [e * a = a * e = a]$$. 

It's not compulsory for a <span style="color:blue">semigroup</span> to have an _identity_. However, for any algebraic structure to be <span style="color:blue">monoid</span>, it must have an _identity_ element. Can there be more than one _identity_ element though? 

<span style="color:Sienna">Theorem:</span> _If (two-sided) identity exists, then it is unique_. Suppose that there exist an identity element $$e_1$$. <br>
<span style="color:Sienna">Proof:</span> We know that for all $$a \in A \space [e_1 * a = a * e_1 = a]$$. Further, let's assume that there is another identity element $$e_2$$. By replacing $$a$$ with $$e_1$$ and $$e_1$$ with $$e_2$$, we get $$e_2 * e_1 = e_1 * e_2 = e_1$$. However, we also know that $$e_1$$ is an _identity_ element and therefore $$e_2 * e_1 = e_1 * e_2 = e_2$$. As a result, we get $$e_1 = e_2$$. We can conclude that if there is an identity element, then it must be unique - so actualy it is _the_ identity element of the algebraic structure.

<span style="color:Sienna">Theorem:</span> _If $$l$$ and $$r$$ are left and right identities of a semigroup G, then $$l = r$$_. <br>
<span style="color:Sienna">Proof:</span> If $$l$$ is a left-identity then it follows that $$l * r = r$$. If $$r$$ is a right-identity then it follows that $$l * r = l$$. So it proves that $$l = r$$.


<span style="color:MediumPurple">Q2:</span> An interesting question to impose at this point is that if a <span style="color:blue">semigroup</span> may have two different one-sided identity. <br>
<span style="color:MediumPurple">A2:</span> Let's define a binary operation on set $$A$$ such that $$x * y = y \space \forall x, y \in A  $$. First, we have to make sure that it is <span style="color:SeaGreen">associative</span>, otherwise this wouldn't be a <span style="color:blue">semigroup</span>. $$a * (b * c) = a * c = c$$ and $$(a * b) * c = b * c = c$$ - so it satisfies the <span style="color:SeaGreen">associativity</span>. Notice that there are more than one left-identity in this <span style="color:blue">semigroup</span>. This shows that there may be more than one left identity in a <span style="color:blue">semigroup</span>. However, observe that there is no right identity in this <span style="color:blue">semigroup</span>.


<span style="color:MediumPurple">Q3:</span> Would the answer change if I asked the same question for <span style="color:blue">monoids</span>? <br>
<span style="color:MediumPurple">A3:</span> Well, yes. Because <span style="color:blue">monoids</span> have their own unique _identity_ elements. By the definition, an _identity_ element is both a _left identity_ and a _right identity_. We proved that if there are both _left identity_ $$l$$ and _right identity_ $$r$$ in the <span style="color:blue">semigroup</span> $$G$$, then it must hold that $$l = r$$. A <span style="color:blue">monoid</span> is, by definition, a <span style="color:blue">semigroup</span>. So, if there is an _identity_ element in the structure, there cannot be more than one left or right identity elements (in short, all of them will be the same elements).


##### 2.3) Group <a name="group"></a>
<span style="color:red">Definition 2.4:</span> An algebraic structure $$G = [A, *]$$ is called a <span style="color:blue">group</span> $$\iff$$
1. $$G$$ is a <span style="color:blue">monoid</span>. 
2. $$\forall a \in A$$, there is a unique inverse of $$a$$, denoted by $$a^{-1}$$.

As in the above, let's define the _inverse_ element. Let $$G = [A, *]$$ be a monoid with the identity $$e$$. Let $$a \in A$$. 

<span style="color:red">Definition 2.5:</span> 
1. $$l_a \in A$$ is called _left-inverse_ of $$a$$ $$\iff  l_a * a = e$$
2. $$r_a \in A$$ is called _right-inverse_ of $$a$$ $$\iff   a * r_a = e$$
3. $$b_a \in A$$ is called _(two sided) inverse_ of $$a$$ $$\iff  b_a * a = a * b_a = e$$

<span style="color:Sienna">Theorem:</span> If $$l_a$$ and $$r_a$$ are left and right inverses of $$a$$, respectively, then $$l = r$$ in a monoid. <br>
<span style="color:Sienna">Proof:</span> As stated in [Definition 2.1](#semigroup), a <span style="color:blue">semigroup</span> must have associativity. A <span style="color:blue">monoid</span> is by definition a <span style="color:blue">semigroup</span>. By the associativity, $$l_a * a * r_a = (l_a * a) * r_a = l_a * (a * r_a)$$ holds. <br>
<p style="center">
$$\begin{align*}
l_a * a * r_a &= (l_a * a) * r_a = l_a * (a * r_a)  \\ 
&=  e * r_a = l_a * e  \\
&=  r_a = l_a  
\end{align*}$$
</p>


<span style="color:Sienna">Theorem:</span> In a group, _cancellation_ property holds: <br>
1. $$a * b = a * c \Rightarrow b = c$$ <br>
2. $$b * a = c * a \Rightarrow b = c$$ <br>

<span style="color:Sienna">Proof:</span> By [definition](#group), $$\forall a \in A$$, there is a unique inverse of $$a$$ in $$A$$, denoted as $$a^{-1}$$. 
<p style="center">
$$
\begin{align*}
 a * b &= a * c \\
a^{-1} * a * b &= a^{-1} * a * c    \\
(a^{-1} * a) * b &= (a^{-1} * a) * c \\  
e * b &= e * c \\ 
b &= c 
\end{align*}
$$
</p>
Second proposition can be proved with exactly the same idea.

This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using [MathJax 3](https://www.mathjax.org/) engine. You just need to surround your math expression with `$$`, like `$$ E = mc^2 $$`. If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like $$ E = mc^2 $$.

To use display mode, again surround your expression with `$$` and place it as a separate paragraph. Here is an example:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^\infty |\langle x, e_k \rangle|^2 \leq \|x\|^2
$$

You can also use `\begin{equation}...\end{equation}` instead of `$$` for display mode math.
MathJax will automatically number equations:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cauchy-schwarz}
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
\end{equation}

and by adding `\label{...}` inside the equation environment, we can now refer to the equation using `\eqref`.

Note that MathJax 3 is [a major re-write of MathJax](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html) that brought a significant improvement to the loading and rendering speed, which is now [on par with KaTeX](http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php).
