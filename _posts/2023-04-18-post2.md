Started reading this exciting book. I'll be posting my notes here.

## Glossary
* Contingent: A being that is possible to be and not to be. A contingent proposition is neither [necessarily true](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessarily_true) nor necessarily false. 
- Logical necessity: A proposition is logically necessary if it is not _logically_ possible for it to be false. (It's slightly different than tautology - there is a little nuance here, but I'll leave it for now.)
    - A **logically necessary being** is a being whose non-existence is a logical impossibility, and which therefore exists either timeless or eternally in all possible worlds.
