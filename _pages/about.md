Greetings, thanks for stopping by.

I'm a M.Sc. student in Machine Learning at [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/studium/studiengaenge/machine-learning/).
I graduated with a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering at [Boğaziçi University](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/). Overall, I'm interested in Machine Learning and Theoretical Computer Science.  

Apart from that, I have a keen interest in maintaining a regular gym routine and exploring texts that delve into the realms of philosophy of religion (if I could find some time hopefully).

If you are interested in my work or would like to chat about common interests, potential collaboration, etc., please feel free to get in touch!
