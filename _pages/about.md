Greetings.

I am an undergraduate Computer Engineering student at [Boğaziçi University](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/). I'm interested in Deep Learning and Theoretical Computer Science.  
Currently, we are working on creating a [Turkish Word Embeddings Repository](https://github.com/Turkish-Word-Embeddings/Word-Embeddings-Repository-for-Turkish) as our bachelor's project. Our aim is to compare the performances of different state-of-the-art word embedding models on Turkish language and to provide a repository for the Turkish language community.
