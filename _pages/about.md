Greetings, thanks for stopping by.

<<<<<<< HEAD
I'm a M.Sc. student in Machine Learning at [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/studium/studiengaenge/machine-learning/).
I graduated with a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering at [Boğaziçi University](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/). Overall, I'm interested in Machine Learning and Theoretical Computer Science.  

Besides that, you can discover some of my writings discussing the books I've read on my blog.

If you are interested in my work or would like to chat about common interests, potential collaboration, etc., please feel free to get in touch!

Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
